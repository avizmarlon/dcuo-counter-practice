Most files are for test purpose only.
The file that actually does the work is core-ahk.ahk.

### Note

Unfortunately, ControlSend doesn't work with DCUO (ControlClick does though, read notes.txt for more info). You have to execute the script in a different computer (or a virtual machine, good luck with performance issues btw).

Some of the core script uses snippets from the [Control Click Tester](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/82924-basic-controlclick-tester/) made by @girlgamer.

I also used [Send and Click Tool V4.1](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/95653-send-and-click-tool-v41/), made by @SnowFlake_FlowSnake.
