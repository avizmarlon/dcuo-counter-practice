Use ControlClick

 - Temporarily change in-game keybinding (any key) to a mouse button.
 - Only change when an action that involves a key other than a mouse button needs to be done.

This is because ControlSend doesn't work, but ControlClick does, however it only sends mouse button presses, so you have to map a keyboard key to a mouse button temporarily according to the iteration in the loop.

============================

Use Joystick buttons

 - Map joystick buttons to keyboard buttons
 - Use joystick buttons in-game instead of keyboard (make use of in-game joystick support)

===========================
Upper-case letter uses shift in-game, and the shift actually works, but it doesn't work when I try sending "shift" itself.

 - Map shift to a different button and send a random upper-case letter so that when the script presses shift to make it upper-case, it will actually send the key you mapped to the shift button.

==========================
Test VMware (Send {key})

=========================
Test Microsoft's Virtual PC (Send {key})

======================
Test: Send, function() -> function sends controlsend {key}
Test: ControlSend, function() - > function sends send {key}

============================
Try pywin32 libs

============================
Try PostMessage to inactive window
Try PostMessage a function that Send {key} or ControlSend {key}
